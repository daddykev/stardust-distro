> Open-source, npm-installable music distribution platform for the modern music industry.

Stardust Distro enables labels, artists, and distributors to deploy a fully functional, DDEX-compliant distribution system in minutes. **Every feature, every protocol, every line of code is MIT licensed and free forever.**

## üéØ True Open Source Philosophy

**Stardust Distro is 100% open source.** The entire platform is MIT licensed with no paid tiers, no enterprise edition, and no artificial limitations. You get a complete, production-ready distribution system with ALL delivery protocols (FTP, SFTP, S3, API, Azure), full ERN generation, and everything needed to run a professional distribution platform.

We believe in building trust through transparency. The core platform is and will always be completely free and fully functional.

### Plug-in Marketplace
For specialized needs, we're developing an **open plug-in marketplace** where both our team and **third-party developers** can offer commercial and free plug-ins. This creates a thriving ecosystem of extensions while keeping the core platform 100% open source. These plug-ins are entirely optional - the core Stardust Distro platform is complete and production-ready without any plug-ins.

The marketplace will be **open to all developers**, fostering innovation and allowing the community to build specialized solutions for unique industry needs. Whether you're a developer looking to monetize your expertise or share free tools with the community, the plug-in marketplace will provide the infrastructure to distribute your extensions.

### Why This Matters
- **No vendor lock-in**: Deploy and use forever without paying a cent
- **No artificial limits**: No release caps, no watermarks, no time bombs
- **Complete functionality**: Every feature needed for professional distribution
- **True community ownership**: Fork it, modify it, deploy it - it's yours
- **Vibrant ecosystem**: Buy plugins from various developers or build your own
