## Import Modes Overview

Stardust Distro offers two powerful import modes accessible via the Migration interface:

| Mode | Steps | Requirements | Use Case |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Standard Mode** | 3 steps | CSV + Audio + Images | When you have complete metadata in spreadsheet format |
| **Metadata-less Mode** | 2 steps | DDEX-named audio files only | When you only have audio files but they follow DDEX naming |

### Mode Toggle
Switch between modes using the "Metadata-less" button in the Migration header. The interface dynamically adjusts steps and requirements based on the selected mode.

## Standard Mode (CSV + Files)

### Three-Step Workflow

#### Step 1: Import Catalog Metadata
Upload and map your CSV file containing release and track information.

#### Step 2: Upload Files  
Batch upload audio files and cover images with DDEX-compliant naming.

#### Step 3: Match & Create
System automatically matches files to metadata and creates draft releases.

### CSV Import Features

#### Automatic Field Detection
The system intelligently detects common column name variations:
- Title: `title`, `release_title`, `album_title`, `name`
- Artist: `artist`, `display_artist`, `album_artist`, `performer`
- UPC: `upc`, `barcode`, `ean`, `gtin`
- Track Title: `track_title`, `song_title`, `track_name`
- Track Number: `track_number`, `track_no`, `track_#`, `sequence`

#### Field Mapping Interface
- Visual mapping grid showing CSV headers and target fields
- Required fields marked with asterisk (*)
- Auto-populated suggestions based on column names
- Dropdown selectors for each field mapping
- Validation before proceeding

#### CSV Validation
- Required field checking
- UPC format validation (12-14 digits)
- Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Row count and parsing confirmation
- Error reporting with specific row numbers

### File Upload System

#### Audio Upload Area
- Drag-and-drop zone or click to browse
- Multiple file selection supported
- Accepts WAV, FLAC, MP3 formats
- Real-time DDEX naming validation
- Individual file upload progress bars
- Shows uploaded count and file names

#### Image Upload Area

- Supports JPG, PNG formats
- Validates image dimensions
- Shows thumbnail previews after upload
- Tracks cover vs additional images

---

## Metadata-less Mode (Files Only)

### Revolutionary Two-Step Process

#### Step 1: Upload DDEX-Compliant Files
Upload audio files (and optionally images) that follow DDEX naming convention.

#### Step 2: Automatic Metadata & Match
System extracts UPCs, fetches metadata from Deezer, and creates complete releases.

### Deezer Integration Details

#### Metadata Fetching Process
1. **UPC Extraction**
   - Parses filenames for UPC patterns
   - Groups files by unique UPC
   - Shows count of unique releases found

2. **API Query Sequence**
   - Queries Deezer API by UPC
   - Shows real-time progress: "Fetching metadata for UPC {upc}..."
   - Implements 500ms rate limiting between calls
   - Handles API failures gracefully

3. **Data Retrieved**
   - Album: Title, artist, label, release date, genre
   - Tracks: Title, artist, ISRC, duration, track number
   - Cover art: Multiple resolutions available
   - Additional: Track count, album duration

#### Cover Art Management

##### Intelligent Detection
- Checks if user uploaded cover for each UPC
- Identifies releases needing artwork
- Counts total artwork requirements

##### User Confirmation Dialog
When Deezer artwork is available:
- Modal shows preview grid of available covers
- Lists number of releases needing artwork
- Radio button choices:
  - "Use Deezer artwork for releases without covers"
  - "Continue without cover art (not recommended)"
- Artwork quality indicator (XL = 1000x1000px)

##### Download Process
- Downloads from Deezer CDN
- Stores in Firebase Storage: `imports/{userId}/{importJobId}/deezer-artwork/{UPC}-xl.jpg`
- Adds source metadata tag
- Shows download progress
- Integrates with matching system

### Visual Progress Indicators

#### Metadata Fetch Card
- Spinner icon with "Fetching Metadata from Deezer" header
- Current status text
- Progress details showing:
  - Current UPC being processed
  - X of Y releases processed
  - Progress bar

#### Fetched Metadata Display
After successful fetch:
- Success icon with count of retrieved releases
- Card for each release showing:
  - Album cover thumbnail (if available)
  - Title and artist
  - UPC and track count
  - Track list preview (first 3 tracks)
  - Cover art source indicator

## File Naming Requirements

### DDEX-Compliant Naming Convention

All files must follow DDEX standard naming to enable automatic matching:

#### Audio Files
```
Format: {UPC}_{DiscNumber}_{TrackNumber}.{extension}
Pattern: \d{12,14}_\d{2}_\d{3}\.(wav|flac|mp3)
Example: 669158552979_01_001.wav
```

Components:
- **UPC**: 12-14 digit barcode
- **DiscNumber**: Two digits (01, 02, etc.)
- **TrackNumber**: Three digits (001, 002, etc.)
- **Extension**: wav, flac, or mp3

#### Cover Images
```
Format: {UPC}.{extension}
Pattern: \d{12,14}\.(jpg|jpeg|png)
Example: 669158552979.jpg
```

#### Additional Images
```
Format: {UPC}_{ImageNumber}.{extension}
Pattern: \d{12,14}_\d{2}\.(jpg|jpeg|png)
Example: 669158552979_02.jpg
```

### Validation Messages

The system provides real-time validation feedback:
- ‚úÖ Valid: "669158552979_01_001.wav - Valid (UPC: 669158552979)"
- ‚ùå Invalid: "Track 1.wav - Invalid: Audio files must be named: UPC_DiscNumber_TrackNumber.wav"

## Matching System

### Matching Algorithm

The system matches files to releases using:

1. **UPC Extraction**
   - From filename for audio/images
   - From CSV for metadata

2. **File Association**
   - Audio: Match by UPC + Disc + Track
   - Cover: Match by UPC (main image)
   - Additional: Match by UPC + number

3. **Completeness Check**
   - All tracks have audio files
   - Cover image present
   - Required metadata complete

### Match Results Categories

#### ‚úÖ Complete Releases
- All audio files matched
- Cover image present
- Full metadata available
- ‚Üí Creates draft releases automatically

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete Releases  
- Some files matched
- Missing audio or images identified
- Partial metadata
- ‚Üí Shows details in modal
- ‚Üí Can complete manually later

#### ‚ùå Failed Matches
- No files matched
- Invalid naming
- Missing in Deezer (metadata-less mode)
- ‚Üí Shows error details
- ‚Üí Requires manual intervention

### MigrationStatus Component

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### CSV Import Problems

**"CSV parsing failed"**
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding
- Check for comma delimiter
- Remove empty rows
- Verify headers present

**"Required column missing: [field]"**
- Check column exists in CSV
- Verify header spelling
- Map field manually if needed

**"Invalid UPC format"**
- Must be 12-14 digits
- Remove spaces/dashes
- Check for typos

#### File Upload Issues

**"Invalid file names"**
- Follow DDEX pattern exactly
- Use correct digit counts (2 for disc, 3 for track)
- Check file extensions

**"Upload failed"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify file size < 200MB
- Try smaller batches
- Clear browser cache

#### Metadata-less Mode Issues

**"No valid UPCs found in uploaded files"**
- Files must follow DDEX naming
- Check UPC is 12-14 digits
- Verify underscore placement

**"Could not fetch metadata from Deezer"**
- Release may not be in Deezer
- Check UPC is correct
- Internet connection required
- Try Standard Mode instead

**"Artwork download failed"**
- Temporary CDN issue
- Retry download
- Upload manually if persistent

#### Matching Problems

**"No matching files found"**
- Verify DDEX naming
- Check UPCs match between CSV and files
- Ensure files uploaded successfully

**"Incomplete release"**
- View details to see missing items
- Upload missing files
- Check track numbering

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Imports
- Process in batches of 50-100 releases
- Use wired internet connection
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Use Chrome for best performance
- Import during off-peak hours

#### Upload Speed Tips
- Use FLAC over WAV (smaller size)
- Compress images to <10MB
- Upload audio and images separately
- Monitor progress bars

### Error Messages Guide

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "File too large" | File > 200MB | Compress or split file |
| "Invalid format" | Wrong file type | Use WAV/FLAC/MP3 for audio |
| "Duplicate UPC" | UPC already exists | Skip or update existing |
| "Network timeout" | Slow connection | Retry or check internet |
| "Session expired" | Logged out | Log in and resume |
