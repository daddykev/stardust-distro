## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-30

### üîÑ Template Genericization & Dynamic Configuration

This release makes the template fully generic and reusable, removing all hard-coded references to "Stardust Distro" in favor of dynamic configuration.

#### **Major Refactoring**
- **Template Genericization**: Removed all hard-coded "stardust-distro" and "Stardust Distro" references from non-documentation files
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Template now uses environment variables for all branding and identification
- **Simplified Environment Variables**:
  - Consolidated `VITE_APP_NAME` into `VITE_ORGANIZATION_NAME` (single source of truth for branding)
  - Removed unused `VITE_ORGANIZATION_ID` (keeping only `VITE_DISTRIBUTOR_ID` for DDEX)
  - Cleaner `.env.example` with only essential configuration

#### **CLI Improvements**
- **Enhanced `create` command**:
  - Dynamically processes template files during project creation
  - Updates `package.json`, `index.html`, and Docker scripts with project name
  - Generates customized `.env` file based on user input
  - Removes template lock files to be regenerated fresh
  - Better error handling with stack traces
  - Added Firebase Blaze plan requirement warning

#### **Code Updates**
- **Services**: Updated all service files to use environment variables:
  - `ern.js`, `mead.js`, `delivery.js`: Use `VITE_ORGANIZATION_NAME` for sender name
  - `delivery.js`, `ern.js`: Use `VITE_DISTRIBUTOR_ID` for DDEX identification
  - `emailService.js`: Dynamic organization name in all email templates
  - `productMetadata.js`: Dynamic Firebase project ID in API URLs

- **Vue Components**:
  - `NavBar.vue`, `Login.vue`, `Signup.vue`: Use `VITE_ORGANIZATION_NAME` for display
  - `EditRelease.vue`, `NewDelivery.vue`: Use `VITE_DISTRIBUTOR_ID` for DDEX messages

- **Email Templates**: All email content now uses dynamic organization name
- **Functions**: Updated Cloud Functions to use dynamic organization names in emails

#### **Developer Experience**
- Template can now be used as-is for any music distribution platform
- Single configuration point for organization branding
- Attribution to original project preserved in package.json names
- Clearer separation between template and generated project
